# static-site-seed
Seed project for a static site based on Gatsby.

- Using web-components from https://github.com/Uiseguys/stencil-bs-ui-lib
- Using i18next translation provided through https://github.com/Uiseguys/loopback3-i18next

It's a sister project of:
 https://github.com/Uiseguys/ng-bs-redux-boilerplate
as well being an integration test for the projects listed above.
Also a very nice boilerplate/seed project for static sites
